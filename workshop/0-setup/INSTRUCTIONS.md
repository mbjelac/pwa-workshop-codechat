# Setup

Before you get started with this workshop, there's a few things you'll need to get setup.

## Browsers & environment

- [ ] Latest Chrome browser
- [ ] Latest Microsoft Edge (you'll need two browsers to test properly)
- [ ] Latest Node (v20+) - Run `npm n latest` to update your node

I recommend you specifically use Chrome + Edge because the two together cover all the APIs we'll be using in this workshop. If you'd rather use another browser, make sure you reference [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com) for feature support.


## Clone repository

[Clone this repository](https://github.com/ireade/pwa-workshop-codechat) to your machine

## Firebase

This workshop makes use of Firebase for both Hosting and Cloud Functions. 

### Setup project
1. Create a [Firebase account](https://firebase.google.com) - it's completely free to sign up
1. Create a new project via the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
1. Add Firebase to your Web App

    As part of this process, you'll receive firebase configuration details. You don't need to do anything with this yet.

### Enable functions **
1. In your Console sidebar, go to Build > Functions 
1. Click "upgrade project" to enable Firebase Functions
    - This will require you to add a payment card and update to the Blaze Plan, but don't worry, it's usage-based and for the purposes of this workshop you shouldn't be charged up to $1 .

** This is a recommended but optional step. If you can't or don't want to put a card on file, I have provided a [backup firebase function URL](../3-push-notifications/backup_firebase_function.md) that will be available during the hours of this workshop.

### CLI
1. Install [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) package (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
1. Sign in via the command line (`firebase login`)
1. Within the directory, run `firebase init`
    1. Select "Functions" and "Hosting" options
