# Step 2 - File System Access and File Handling

In this step, we'll be building the core capabilities of the code editor. 

## 2.1 Get and display file contents

_Work in **src/app/code-editor.js**_

1. Add a button to open a file (via `openFile()` function), and a fallback for browsers that don't support this functionality
    ```js
    if ((typeof window !== "undefined") && 'showOpenFilePicker' in window) {}
    ```
1. In the `openFile()` function:
    1. Copy the following code:
        ```js
        let f;
        [f] = await window.showOpenFilePicker({
            multiple: false,
            excludeAcceptAllOption: true,
            types: []
        });
        ```
    1. Inside the `types` array, add the following object
        ```
       {
           description: "Frontend development files",
           accept: {
               "text/*": [".html", ".css", ".js"]
           }
       }
       ```
       Feel free to edit to allow your file editor to open your choice of file types!
    1. Call `handleFile(f)`
1. Within the `handleFile()` function:
    1. Copy the following code:
        ```js
        const file = await f.getFile();
        const contents = await file.text();
        ```
    1. Use the `setFileName()`, `setFileContents()` and `setFileHandle()` so save `file.name`, `contents`, and `f` respectively

**üß™ TEST** - Now, you can test this by trying to open a file. Note that you may want to wrap your code in a try/catch block to handle potential errors. 

## 2.2 Save file back to disc

1. Within the `saveFile()` function:
    1. Copy the following code:
        ```js
        const writable = await fileHandle.createWritable();
        await writable.write(fileContents);
        await writable.close();
        ```
    1. Call `closeFile()`
1. Within the `closeFile()` function:
    1. Use the `setFileName()`, `setFileContents()` and `setFileHandle()` variables to set the variables to `null`

**üß™ TEST** - Now you can try saving a file. Re-open that same file to see if your changes were saved.

## 2.3 Allow file handling

_Work in **src/manifest.json**_

1. Add `file_handlers` to your manifest.json
    - This accepts an array of objects, e.g. - 
        ```json
           [{
             "action": "/",
             "accept": {
               "text/html": [".html"]
             }
           }]
        ```
    - Add an object for each type of file we want to accept 
    - See [Common MIME Types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types)


## 2.4 Manage file handling

_Work in **src/app/code-editor.js**_

1. Inside the `useEffect()` function, copy the following code:
    ```js
    if (typeof window !== "undefined" && 
       "launchQueue" in window && 
       "LaunchParams" in window && 
       "files" in LaunchParams.prototype) {
        launchQueue.setConsumer((launchParams) => {
            if (!launchParams.files.length) return;
    
            for (const f of launchParams.files) {
                console.log(f);
            }
        });
    }
    ```
1. Within the loop of `launchParams.files`, call the `handleFile()` function, passing in `f`

**üß™ TEST** - To test this, you'll need to make sure the application is installed on your device and the browser you installed it with does support file handling. Then, you can go to a file, right click to open the file with a specific application, and you should see the PWA listed. 

If you don't see your application listed, you may be using a slightly older browser version. In the list of potential applications, select "Other", then "Enable All Applications" and search for your installed PWA.

If you still don't see your application, double check that you're using the latest version of Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
